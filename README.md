# Dialogue Writer App

## About

This was a project I created to help learn ReactJS. I had two goals:

1) learn to use ES6 class syntax
2) learn to use state and props

I always like to build projects that I would actually use, so I chose to make an app that lets users write dialogues.
I would use this in my language classes. I have taught English in Taiwan for the last three years and I still work as
a substitute teacher in a few schools.
